# OpenScreenShot

> Open-source screenshot tool for Chrome — full-page, region, and visible-area capture with an annotation editor and PDF export. Built as a Manifest V3 extension.

OpenScreenShot captures the **entire scrolling page** (scroll-and-stitch), the **visible viewport**, or a **selected region**, lets you annotate the result, and export as PNG, JPEG, WebP, or PDF. Everything runs locally in your browser — your data never leaves your device.

## Status

| Milestone | Focus | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Foundation — scaffold, design system, popup, onboarding, visible-area capture | 🚧 In progress |
| M2 | Capture engine — full-page scroll-and-stitch + region selection | Planned |
| M3 | Annotation editor + export (PNG/JPEG/WebP/PDF) | Planned |
| M4 | Polish — settings, shortcuts, i18n, accessibility | Planned |
| M5 | Launch — tests, store listing | Planned |

## Features

- 📄 **Full Page** — scroll-and-stitch the entire page, top to bottom (M2)
- 👁 **Visible Area** — capture what's on screen now
- ✂️ **Selected Region** — click & drag to capture an area (M2)
- ✏️ **Annotation editor** — rectangle, arrow, pen, text, blur, crop (M3)
- 💾 **Export** — PNG, JPEG, WebP, and PDF with multi-page support (M3)
- 🎨 Polished, accessible, dark/light UI (M1 foundation)

## Tech stack

- **TypeScript** (strict) + **Preact** for the popup/editor UI
- **Vite** + **[@crxjs/vite-plugin](https://github.com/crxjs/crxjs)** for Manifest V3 bundling & HMR
- **OffscreenCanvas** for stitching (M2)
- **Vitest** for unit tests, **Playwright** for e2e (planned)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm 10+

### Install & develop

```bash
npm install
npm run icons      # generate the extension icons into public/icons
npm run dev        # start Vite + crxjs with HMR (writes to dist/)
```

Then load the extension in Chrome:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist/` folder

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build      # type-check + bundle into dist/
```

Load `dist/` as an unpacked extension, or run `npm run package` to produce
`openscreenshot-vX.Y.Z.zip` for the Chrome Web Store.

### Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server with extension HMR |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and bundle the extension into `dist/` |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (flat config) |
| `npm test` | Run unit tests (Vitest) |
| `npm run icons` | Regenerate extension icons from the SVG source |
| `npm run format` | Format the codebase with Prettier |
| `npm run package` | Build + zip `dist/` for store submission |

## Permissions

OpenScreenShot requests the minimum permissions needed:

- `activeTab` — access the current tab when you click the extension
- `storage` — remember your settings & onboarding state
- `downloads` — save screenshots to your downloads folder

Later milestones add `scripting` and `offscreen` for full-page capture. We never request broad host permissions (`<all_urls>`).

## Privacy

All capture and processing happens locally in your browser. Screenshots are never uploaded anywhere. See [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) (to be added before store launch).
